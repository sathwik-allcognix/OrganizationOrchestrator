28	- Reporting: You will report to [Reporting Manager Name, Title].
29	<!-- SUGGESTED ADDITION (recommended): Add a short description of the learning objectives, supervision, and restrictions to reduce misclassification risk:

Nothing in this letter creates a contract of employment for any guaranteed period, and you will not be entitled to employment benefits (such as paid leave, medical benefits, gratuity, provident fund, or other employee benefits) unless required by applicable law.~~
34	<!-- SUGGESTED REPLACEMENT (must be included): 
35	"This letter documents a fixed-term stipend internship for training and learning purposes and is not intended to create permanent salaried employment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this letter limits Omninuera's obligation to comply with any statutory entitlements under applicable law (including minimum wage laws, social security (EPF/ESI) obligations, professional tax or other statutory payments) if such laws apply to the engagement as a matter of law.

54	(b) 'Background IP' means intellectual property owned or controlled by you prior to the internship or developed independently outside the scope of the internship.

59	
60	8. Background Checks
61	- This offer is conditional upon Omninuera receiving satisfactory results from any background checks or verifications that Omninuera deems appropriate (education, employment, criminal background, or other checks where permitted).

You are responsible for your personal tax obligations arising from the stipend unless Omninuera is legally required to withhold taxes under applicable law. Where required by law, Omninuera may withhold taxes at source.
74	<!-- SUGGESTED EDIT (must be included): Consider specifying typical withholding mechanics:
