Internship status; statutory compliance (IMPORTANT — HR to confirm classification)
- [OPTION A — IF THE COMPANY INTENDS EMPLOYEE-TYPE ENGAGEMENT:]
  - The parties intend this engagement to be a training-oriented paid internship, but the Candidate may for certain statutory purposes be treated as an employee under Indian law depending on the facts and applicable statutory definitions. Where any law or competent authority determines this engagement to constitute employment, the Company will comply with applicable statutory obligations (including minimum wages, EPF, ESI, TDS/withholding, POSH, and other labour laws) and will make such payments or contributions as required by law.
- [OPTION B — IF THE COMPANY INTENDS REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIP UNDER APPRENTICES ACT:]
  - This engagement is being offered as an Apprenticeship under the Apprentices Act, 1961 and applicable Apprenticeship Rules/NAPS guidelines. The stipend and other terms shall be governed by applicable apprenticeship rules and the Company’s apprenticeship registration. The Candidate’s qualification for apprenticeship (degree/diploma/other) shall determine the minimum stipend under the Apprenticeship Rules.
- [OPTION C — IF THE COMPANY INTENDS NON‑EMPLOYEE TRAINEE/CONSULTANT:]
  - The Company and the Candidate agree that this is a fixed‑term training engagement and does not create an employer‑employee relationship. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any authority or court determines the Candidate to be an employee under applicable law, the Company will comply with statutory obligations and adjust payments accordingly.

Stipend adjustment for statutory minimum wages
- The Company confirms that it will comply with Government‑notified minimum wage requirements. If the Karnataka Government‑notified minimum wage applicable to the category for this role exceeds the stipend stated above, the Company will adjust the stipend to at least the Government‑notified minimum wage and make any retrospective adjustments required by law. (See Karnataka Minimum Wages Notification (01 Apr 2024–31 Mar 2025).)

Tax, social security and statutory deductions
- The stipend is subject to all applicable taxes and statutory deductions under Indian law. The Candidate must provide PAN and Aadhaar (as required) on acceptance. If this engagement is treated as employment under applicable law, the Company will deduct the employee share of statutory contributions where applicable (for example, EPF employee contribution and ESI employee contribution) and will remit employer contributions as required by law.
- EPF/ESI specifics (illustrative; actual application depends on Company headcount and statutory rules): Where EPF applies (generally for establishments with 20 or more employees), EPF contribution is typically 12% of wages each from employer and employee; where ESI applies (subject to threshold), employer and employee contributions will be deducted and remitted at statutory rates. The Company will register and comply with EPF/ESI obligations if applicable.

TDS/withholding
- If the stipend is taxable in substance as per the Income Tax Act, the Company will deduct income tax at source under Section 192 or other applicable provisions. The Candidate is responsible for submitting PAN and any other documentation required for tax purposes. The Candidate is personally responsible for filing income tax returns and paying any additional tax liabilities as required by law.

Confidentiality
- During the internship and thereafter, the Candidate must maintain the confidentiality of Omninuera’s confidential and proprietary information and may not disclose such information to any third party except as authorized in writing by Omninuera. Confidential information includes, but is not limited to, technical data, business plans, product roadmaps, customer information, source code, models, training data, and proprietary materials. The Candidate must return or securely destroy Company confidential materials upon termination.

Intellectual Property
- All inventions, discoveries, developments, designs, code, models, documentation, and other original work product (collectively, “IP”) that the Candidate creates or contributes to during the internship, whether alone or jointly with others, and whether or not created during normal working hours, that are related to Omninuera’s business or resulting from the Candidate’s use of Company resources shall be the sole and exclusive property of Omninuera. The Candidate hereby assigns and agrees to assign to Omninuera all right, title, and interest in such IP and agrees to execute any documents reasonably necessary to effectuate this assignment. The Candidate also irrevocably waives any moral rights in such IP to the extent permitted by law.

Data protection and data access
- If the Candidate will access personal data in the course of the internship, the Candidate must comply with Omninuera’s Data Protection Policy and any Data Processing Agreement (DPA) the Company requires. The Candidate will only access personal data for authorised purposes, must apply anonymization/de‑identification where required, must not export protected personal data outside India without authorization, and must immediately report any data breaches or incidents. The Candidate’s access may be monitored and is subject to audit.

POSH (Sexual harassment) policy
- Omninuera’s POSH policy applies to all personnel. Information on the Company’s POSH policy and the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) contact details are available on request and will be provided on commencement. If the Company’s Bengaluru establishment has ten (10) or more employees, the Company has constituted an ICC and the Candidate is entitled to raise complaints through that mechanism. If the Company has fewer than ten (10) employees, the Candidate retains the right to approach the Local Complaints Committee (LCC) or other statutory forums.

Termination and Notice
- Termination for convenience: Either party may terminate this internship for convenience by providing seven (7) calendar days’ written notice to the other party.
- Termination for cause: Omninuera may terminate the internship immediately for material breach of this offer, misconduct, violation of company policies, or other serious grounds. In the event of termination, the stipend will be pro‑rated to the last day worked and paid in accordance with the payment schedule, subject to applicable deductions. Final payments will be made within the next payroll cycle following termination.

Compliance with Company Policies
- The Candidate must comply with Omninuera’s policies and procedures, including those relating to confidentiality, information security, acceptable use, and workplace conduct. Omninuera may update its policies from time to time.

No Guarantee of Employment
- Completion of the internship does not guarantee an offer of employment. Any offer of employment following the internship will be subject to a separate agreement.
