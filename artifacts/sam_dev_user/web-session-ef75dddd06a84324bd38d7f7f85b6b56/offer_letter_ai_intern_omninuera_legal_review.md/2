Dear Candidate,

We are pleased to offer you a fixed-term internship with Omninuera for the position of AI Intern under the terms set out below. This document is an HR draft for review and is intended to be provided to the candidate; it will be sent to Legal for review prior to finalization.

Position and Term
- Position: AI Intern.
- Duration: 3 months (fixed-term internship).
  [LEGAL SUGGESTION: Consider adding whether extension is possible and on what terms. Insert: "This internship is for a fixed term of three (3) months commencing on [Start Date] and ending on [End Date]. Any extension requires written agreement by both parties." — Recommended.]
- Start Date: [Start Date].
- Reporting to: [Manager Name], [Title].

Work Arrangement and Location
- Work arrangement: Completely remote (remote-first).
- Candidate city (for record): Bengaluru.
- Location clause: This internship is fully remote. Candidate will be based in Bengaluru and must comply with applicable local laws.
  [LEGAL SUGGESTION: Add a governing law/jurisdiction clause (see below). Also clarify working hours. Example insert: "Place of work: Candidate will be based in Bengaluru, India and the internship is remote-first. The Intern shall comply with applicable local laws and ordinances. Working hours are expected to be [e.g., up to 20 hours per week / or specify hours], and any changes will be communicated in writing." — Recommended.]

Stipend and Payment
- Stipend: INR 10,000 per month.
- Payment schedule: The stipend will be paid monthly and will be disbursed within the first week of the following month. All payments are subject to applicable statutory deductions.
  [LEGAL SUGGESTION: Add tax/PAN clause immediately here. Insert (replace current line 22): 
  "Payment schedule and taxes: The stipend will be paid monthly and disbursed within the first week of the following month. The stipend is a training/stipend allowance and is taxable in the Intern’s hands as per Indian tax laws. The Company will deduct taxes at source (TDS) as required by law. The Intern must promptly provide a valid PAN (Permanent Account Number) and any other documents required for tax withholding and reporting. If the Intern fails to provide PAN, the Company may withhold taxes at higher rates as prescribed by law." — Mandatory/Recommended.]

Internship Status
- The internship is a fixed-term, training-oriented engagement and does not constitute employment. It does not confer rights to employment benefits (such as paid leave, insurance, provident fund, or other employee benefits) unless expressly provided in writing by Omninuera.
  [LEGAL SUGGESTION: Strengthen to address misclassification risk. Replace with:
  "Nature of engagement: This engagement is a fixed-term training internship for learning and skill development only and is not an appointment to employment. It does not create an employer–employee relationship and does not entitle the Intern to regular employee benefits (such as paid leave, insurance, provident fund, gratuity, or other statutory or contractual employee benefits), unless expressly provided in writing by Omninuera. The parties agree that the stipend is a training allowance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any statutory authority determines that the Intern qualifies as an 'employee' under any social security law (including the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 or the Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948), the Company shall comply with such directions and may take remedial steps including making contributions or recovering amounts to the extent permitted by law." — Recommended / Important to include for compliance.]
  [OPERATIONAL NOTE: Ensure that internship operation (hours/duties) matches this 'training' description to avoid substance-based reclassification.]

Confidentiality
- During the internship and thereafter, the Candidate must maintain the confidentiality of Omninuera’s confidential and proprietary information and may not disclose such information to any third party except as authorized in writing by Omninuera. Confidential information includes, but is not limited to, technical data, business plans, product roadmaps, customer information, source code, models, training data, and other proprietary materials.
  [LEGAL SUGGESTION: Add exclusions and return obligations. Replace with:
  "Confidentiality: During the internship and thereafter, the Intern must maintain the confidentiality of Omninuera’s confidential and proprietary information and may not disclose such information to any third party except as authorised in writing by Omninuera or as required by law. 'Confidential Information' includes, but is not limited to, technical data, business plans, product roadmaps, customer information, source code, models, training data and other proprietary materials. Confidential Information does not include information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than by breach of this agreement by the Intern; (ii) was in the Intern's lawful possession before receipt from the Company and not subject to a confidentiality obligation; or (iii) is independently developed by the Intern without use of the Company’s Confidential Information. On termination, the Intern shall promptly return or destroy all Company materials and copies containing Confidential Information. The obligations in this paragraph shall survive termination for a period of [2] years, except that trade secrets shall remain confidential for as long as they are trade secrets." — Recommended.]
  [NOTE: Consider longer survival for trade secrets; keep 2 years as baseline for other confidential info.]

Intellectual Property
- All inventions, discoveries, developments, designs, code, models, documentation, and other work product (collectively, “IP”) that the Candidate creates or contributes to during the internship, whether alone or jointly with others, and whether or not created during normal working hours, shall be the sole and exclusive property of Omninuera. The Candidate hereby assigns and agrees to assign to Omninuera all right, title, and interest in such IP and agrees to execute any documents reasonably necessary to effectuate this assignment.
  [LEGAL SUGGESTION: Narrow and clarify pre-existing IP and consideration, and require assistance in execution. Replace with:
  "Intellectual Property: All inventions, discoveries, developments, designs, code, models, documentation and other work product (collectively, 'Internship Work Product' or 'IP') that the Intern solely or jointly creates during the course of the internship and which are directly related to or arise from the Intern’s work for the Company shall be the exclusive property of Omninuera. The Intern hereby assigns and agrees to assign to Omninuera all right, title and interest in such Internship Work Product and will execute, at the Company's expense, documents and do all acts reasonably necessary to vest title in Omninuera. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Intern shall retain ownership of any pre-existing intellectual property or personal projects disclosed in writing to the Company prior to the commencement of the internship. The Intern also agrees to waive or assert no moral rights in favor of the Company to the extent permissible by law. This clause does not seek assignment of ideas or inventions developed entirely outside the scope of the internship and without use of the Company's Confidential Information or resources." — Recommended.]
  [OPERATIONAL NOTE: Keep a written list of candidate pre-existing IP at onboarding to avoid disputes.]

Termination and Notice
- Termination for convenience: Either party may terminate this internship for convenience by providing seven (7) calendar days’ written notice to the other party.
- Termination for cause: Omninuera may terminate the internship immediately for material breach of this offer, misconduct, violation of company policies, or other serious grounds. In the event of termination, stipend will be pro-rated to the last day worked and paid in accordance with the payment schedule, subject to applicable deductions.
- Any early termination will be handled in accordance with Omninuera’s standard exit procedures.
  [LEGAL SUGGESTION: Clarify final payment timeline and effect on IP/confidentiality. Replace/add:
  "Upon termination, the Company will pay any unpaid pro‑rated stipend within [30] days of the intern's last working day, subject to lawful deductions. The Intern’s confidentiality and IP obligations shall survive termination as described above. Examples of 'termination for cause' include gross misconduct, theft, fraud, violation of confidentiality obligations, or conviction of an offence involving moral turpitude." — Recommended.]

Compliance with Company Policies
- The Candidate must comply with Omninuera’s policies and procedures, including those relating to confidentiality, information security, acceptable use, and workplace conduct. Omninuera may update its policies from time to time.
  [LEGAL SUGGESTION: Add POSH policy notice and ICC contact details. Insert:
  "The Intern will be governed by the Company's policies, including its Code of Conduct, Information Security Policy and Sexual Harassment Policy. The Intern is covered under the Company's Sexual Harassment policy and may raise complaints with the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC). ICC contact: [insert ICC name, email, phone]." — Mandatory if workplace has 10+ employees; otherwise recommended.]

Background Verification
- This offer is contingent on satisfactory background verification (education, employment history, and any other checks deemed appropriate by Omninuera). Omninuera reserves the right to withdraw the offer if verification is unsatisfactory.
  [LEGAL SUGGESTION: Replace with explicit consent and retention language. Insert:
  "Background verification and data processing consent: This offer is conditional on satisfactory background verification. By accepting this offer, the Intern expressly consents to the Company (and its authorised third-party vendor) collecting and processing the Intern's personal data for the purpose of verification, including identity, education, employment history, address, and, if necessary, criminal records. The Intern further consents to the Company sharing such data with authorised verification vendors and relevant authorities for the limited purpose of background checks. Background verification data will be retained only for the duration of the internship and for a period of up to 12 months thereafter for recordkeeping and compliance, unless otherwise required by law. The Intern may withdraw consent in writing; however, such withdrawal may prevent completion of onboarding." — Mandatory / Recommended for data protection compliance.]
  [OPERATIONAL NOTE: If criminal records or biometrics are to be collected, obtain explicit separate consent and ensure vendor safeguards.]

Tax and Deductions
- The stipend is subject to all applicable taxes and statutory deductions under Indian law or other applicable jurisdictions. The Candidate is responsible for any personal tax liabilities arising from receipt of the stipend.
  [LEGAL SUGGESTION: Expand to require PAN and confirm TDS basis (move to Stipend section or merge). Insert:
  "Taxation: The stipend is taxable and the Company will deduct taxes at source as per applicable Indian tax laws. The Intern must provide a valid PAN and any other tax-related documentation as requested. If the Intern fails to provide PAN, the Company may withhold taxes at higher rates as applicable under law." — Mandatory/Recommended.]

No Guarantee of Employment
- Completion of the internship does not guarantee an offer of employment. Any offer of employment following the internship will be subject to a separate agreement.
  [LEGAL SUGGESTION: Retain as is. Consider adding "any employment offer will be subject to background check etc."]
