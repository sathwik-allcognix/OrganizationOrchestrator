2. Confidentiality / NDA
   - Confirm enforceability of NDA obligations for interns in India and suggest any additional wording or separate NDA requirements.

3. Stipend Classification
   - Confirm whether classifying the payment as a "stipend" of INR 10,000/month is appropriate versus characterizing as remuneration, contractor fees, or salary for statutory purposes.
   - Advise whether TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) applies, and recommended withholding language.

4. Applicability of Indian Labour Laws and Statutory Benefits
   - Confirm applicability (or exclusion) of EPF/ESI, gratuity, minimum wage rules, and other statutory benefits to fixed-term interns paid stipends.
   - Advise on any mandatory registrations or filings for interns.

5. Notice / Termination and Proration

   - Confirm permissible scope of background checks and necessary consent language.
   - Flag any privacy compliance requirements for collecting and storing personal data (including retention and deletion).

   - Confirm whether cross-border data transfer language is required if systems or cloud services are hosted outside India.

8. Tax Withholding / TDS
   - Confirm whether the stipend is subject to TDS and what obligations the company has to withhold and report.

9. Contract Labeling and Legal Form
   - Confirm whether the document should be titled 'Fixed-Term Internship Agreement' or 'Offer Letter' to meet legal standards.
   - Advise on any required specific wording under Indian law for fixed-term internships.

10. NDAs and Enforceability
    - Confirm enforceability of post-internship confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations for interns.
    - Advise on whether additional consideration is needed to support post-termination restrictions, if any.

11. Any Unusual Clauses
    - Review termination for cause language, IP assignment timing (e.g., upon creation vs. upon disclosure), and the scope of "Work Product."
    - Advise if the clause requiring signing additional documents (e.g., IP assignment forms) should be limited or altered.
