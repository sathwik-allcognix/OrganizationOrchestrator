## REQUIRED CHANGES (must be addressed)

1) Stipend characterization and tax treatment (TDS)
- Issue: The draft does not state whether the stipend is a salary (employment) or a stipend/contractor payment; this affects Income Tax withholding (TDS) and statutory benefits. Ambiguity creates compliance and withholding risk.
- Legal reasoning / Citation: If the relationship is employer-employee (service rendered under contract of service), amounts are taxable under the Income Tax Act; employer must deduct TDS under s.192. If truly a non-employee stipend, different tax treatment may apply but HR must document basis.
- Required action: Insert a clear clause defining the nature of the engagement (employee vs intern/trainee independent contractor) and state tax withholding approach.
- Suggested clause snippet:
  > Stipend and Tax Withholding. The candidate shall receive a monthly stipend of [INR X]. This letter confirms that the engagement is [an employment relationship/a training engagement only — delete as applicable]. The Company will treat the payment as [salary/other income] for Indian tax purposes and will deduct applicable taxes (including TDS under the Income Tax Act, 1961) at source, as required by law. The Candidate must provide PAN and other required information for tax compliance.

2) Statutory deductions and social security applicability (PF, ESIC, Professional Tax)
- Issue: Draft lacks statements on EPF/ESIC/professional tax applicability or employer registrations. These are fact-sensitive and depend on headcount, wage levels, and the statutory definition of "employee".
- Legal reasoning / Citation: EPF Act 1952 and ESIC Act 1948 have thresholds and definitions; non-compliance can attract penalties.
- Required action: Add clause confirming whether EPF and ESIC contributions will apply, and commit to provide statutory benefit details if applicable. If not applicable, provide legal basis (e.g., stipend below threshold or not an employee).
- Suggested clause snippet:
  > Statutory Benefits and Deductions. The Company shall comply with applicable Indian statutory requirements including contributions/deductions under the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and the Employees State Insurance Act, 1948, where these statutes apply. The Company will inform the Candidate in writing if the Candidate is eligible for or enrolled in any statutory schemes and will provide registration/identification numbers where required. Where statute does not apply to this engagement, the Company will provide its legal basis in writing.

3) Shops & Establishments Act (Karnataka) compliance and registration
- Issue: The draft does not address whether the position is governed by Karnataka Shops & Commercial Establishments Act and whether registration is in place.
- Legal reasoning / Citation: The Karnataka Shops and Commercial Establishments Act, 1961 requires registration for establishments and prescribes working hours, overtime, etc., for employees working from Karnataka locations.
- Required action: Clarify the candidate's primary place of work and whether the employer's Karnataka registration applies. If remote work from Karnataka is allowed, confirm compliance with applicable local regulations.
- Suggested clause snippet:
  > Place of Work and Local Registration. The Candidate’s principal place of work will be [Bengaluru / remote]. The Company confirms that it maintains such registrations (including under the Karnataka Shops and Commercial Establishments Act, 1961) as are required by law for employees working at or from Karnataka locations. If the Candidate primarily works from Karnataka, the Company’s policies and statutory entitlements applicable under Karnataka laws will apply.

4) IP assignment — clarity, scope, consideration, and enforceability
- Issue: The draft may assert assignment of IP without precise definitions, scope, or consideration. For interns, courts scrutinize assignment scope and existence of consideration.
- Legal reasoning / Citation: Under Copyright Act 1957 s.17(2), for works created in the course of employment the employer may be first owner subject to contract; express written agreements help enforce ownership. For inventions, patents require explicit assignment. Ambiguous clauses can be challenged.
- Required action: Add a clear IP clause defining "Company IP", "Work Product", ownership, pre-existing IP, moral rights waiver (to the extent permitted), and state consideration (even nominal) for assignment where appropriate.
- Suggested clause snippet:
  > Intellectual Property. The Candidate agrees that all inventions, designs, developments, discoveries, improvements, works of authorship, algorithms, models, data sets, source code, documentation and other material conceived, created or developed by the Candidate, alone or with others, in the course of or as a result of the Candidate’s engagement with the Company (together, Work Product) shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company. The Candidate hereby assigns to the Company all rights, title and interest in and to the Work Product, including copyright, subject to applicable Indian law (see Copyright Act, 1957 s.17). The Candidate shall promptly disclose such Work Product and execute documents reasonably required to perfect the Company’s rights. Pre-existing IP of the Candidate is excluded and must be listed in an annex.

5) Confidentiality and data-protection specifics for remote work (including IT Act risks)
- Issue: Current confidentiality and data protection language may be generic and not address remote-work controls (devices, access, transfer of data), nor cite obligations under IT Act and 2011 Rules.
- Legal reasoning / Citation: IT Act 2000 (s.43A deals with compensation for failure to protect data; s.72A penalizes disclosure of personal data). The 2011 Rules prescribe reasonable security practices. Remote work increases risk; contractual obligations should require specified security controls and incident reporting.
- Required action: Add explicit obligations for remote work: secure devices, VPN, encryption, access control, reporting incidents; limitation on data transfer; express consent to background checks (see separate item). Reference statutory duties and potential penalties.
- Suggested clause snippet:
  > Data Protection, Confidentiality and Remote Work Security. The Candidate shall maintain confidentiality of Company Confidential Information and comply with the Company’s data security policies, including but not limited to: (a) using company-managed devices or approved endpoint security; (b) connecting to Company systems only via Company-approved VPN; (c) employing encryption on devices storing Company data; (d) not storing Company Confidential Information on personal cloud accounts; and (e) promptly reporting any security incident or data breach. The Candidate agrees that personal data processing will be performed in compliance with applicable Indian laws including the Information Technology Act, 2000 and related rules. The Candidate acknowledges potential civil and criminal liability for unauthorized disclosure under applicable laws (including s.72A, IT Act).

6) Governing law and jurisdiction clause — specificity and enforceability
- Issue: If the draft states governing law as India without clear forum, there may be confusion if arbitration is intended.
- Legal reasoning: Parties may select governing law and forum; specifying Bengaluru/Karnataka and whether disputes go to courts or arbitration reduces uncertainty.
- Required action: Insert a clear governing law clause and dispute resolution forum (courts or arbitration) with seat specified as Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.
- Suggested clause snippet:
  > Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Letter shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India. The parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Bengaluru, Karnataka, India for any disputes arising out of or in connection with this Letter. [Or: Disputes shall be finally resolved by arbitration seated in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.]

7) Termination and notice — clarity of notice, stipend on termination, cause/for-cause termination
- Issue: Draft may omit clear notice periods, effect on stipend, and immediate termination for misconduct.
- Legal reasoning: Clear termination terms reduce employment disputes; also must align with applicable labour laws if candidate is an employee.
- Required action: Define notice periods for both sides, stipend pro-ration, termination for cause examples, and immediate termination rights for misconduct or security breaches.
- Suggested clause snippet:
  > Termination. Either party may terminate this engagement by providing [X] days’ prior written notice. The Company may terminate with immediate effect for cause, including serious misconduct, breach of confidentiality, material breach of data security policies, or falsification of information. On termination, the Candidate will deliver all Company property and confidential information. Any stipend payable will be pro-rated to the last working date and payable in accordance with Company payroll practices.

8) Background checks and mandatory consent
- Issue: Background checks may be referenced without candidate consent or scope; required to comply with privacy laws.
- Legal reasoning: Background checks must be by consent and limited to necessary data; processing of personal data should have lawful basis and be disclosed.
- Required action: Add explicit consent clause for background verification, scope, and data retention; require candidate to confirm accuracy of information and provide disclosures of adverse outcomes.
- Suggested clause snippet:
  > Background Verification. The Candidate’s offer is subject to satisfactory background verification, including identity, education, employment history and criminal record checks as permitted by law. The Candidate hereby provides consent to the Company and its agents to conduct such checks and to process relevant personal data for this purpose. The Company shall handle such personal data in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

9) Mandatory disclosures — pay breakup, PAN/bank details, statutory IDs
- Issue: Offer must inform the Candidate of required data submission for payroll and statutory compliance (PAN for TDS, bank details, etc.)
- Required action: Add a clause listing mandatory documents and the Candidate’s obligation to provide them prior to payment commencing.
- Suggested clause snippet:
  > Mandatory Documentation. The Candidate must provide PAN, bank account details, proof of identity, and any other documents reasonably required for payroll and statutory compliance. The Company will not be responsible for delays in stipend payments resulting from incomplete documentation.

## RECOMMENDED CHANGES (best practice / strengthen enforceability)

1) Consider a short written “Intern/Training Agreement” annex
- Rationale: A separate annex or schedule that defines learning objectives, supervision, confidentiality, IP treatment, and evaluation criteria reduces later disputes.
- Suggested approach: Attach an "Internship Addendum" describing purpose, duration, mentor, deliverables, and intellectual property allocation (if any).

2) Include express clause on pre-existing IP and open-source contributions
- Rationale: Protect both parties if candidate brings pre-existing code or contributions to open-source.
- Suggested snippet:
  > Candidate Pre-existing IP. Candidate shall provide a list of pre-existing IP brought to the Company. Any use of open-source software by the Candidate must comply with the Company’s open-source policy.

3) Insurance / Indemnity — limited
- Rationale: Consider whether the Company provides or expects the candidate to have health insurance; for longer internships, consider limited indemnity for gross negligence only.
- Suggested text (optional): brief statement on whether any insurance is provided.

4) Data retention and deletion after exit
- Rationale: Specify retention period for candidate-related data and obligations to delete company-sensitive data after exit.
- Suggested snippet:
  > Data Retention. The Company may retain basic records for [X] years as required by law. Candidate covenants to delete Company Confidential Information from personal devices within 48 hours of termination and certify deletion upon request.

5) Clarify paid leave / sick leave applicability
- Rationale: Avoid confusion about entitlement for internships.
- Suggested snippet:
  > Leave. The Candidate will be entitled to [X] days of paid/unpaid leave during the internship; any statutory leave required by law will apply.

6) Dispute escalation and internal grievance mechanism
- Rationale: Include an internal complaint/grievance escalation path before litigation/arbitration for speed and compliance.
- Suggested snippet: short internal process with timelines.

## Practical implementation notes for HR
- Before finalizing, confirm the operational facts: (a) Is the intern an employee under payroll? (b) Where will the intern physically perform duties (Bengaluru office, other state, or fully remote)? (c) Expected monthly stipend amount. (d) Will company provide devices or will intern use a personal device? (e) Will intern be given access to sensitive personal data of third parties? Legal recommendations are fact-based and may change depending on these answers.
- If the internship is to be structured as a short-term trainee (non-employee), prepare a short legal rationale memorandum for recordkeeping explaining why statutory schemes do/do not apply.
- If HR wants Legal to prepare a redline integrating these suggested clauses directly into the draft offer, please send the latest draft and confirm which suggested clauses HR wants inserted. Legal will produce a redline copy.
